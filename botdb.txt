!hymn Every time I watch a grixis player cast hymn and die to combo the following turn I have an unreasonable amount of joy.
!hymn You incorrectly decided Liliana of the Veil and Hymn are good magic cards.
!hymn I'd rather just cast TS and not cross my fingers to either draw the hymn nut or hit their TNN.
!hymn Legacy has shifted in a direction where specific cards matter much more than raw quantity. Most of the fair decks have only 4-6 cards that actually matter, so hymn sucks.
!hymn People cast hymn on turn 2 against combo because they enjoy losing.
!hymn If you sleeve up your first hymn before your third thoughtseize you're just trying to have an early dinner.
!hymn Luck is thinking Hymn makes your deck better. Varience just proves how wrong you are
!hymn Hymn blows. Feel free to @ me
!hymn Hymn isn't a threat in your glacially slow control deck. I really hope they don't recover in the 15 more turns they have.
!hymn Licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets.
!hymn Hymn to Tourach: When actually having to think is too darn hard

!ban Cards don't get banned for how jank uses them, they get banned for how delver uses them.

!oko The effect of elking any elks or elks, when at a high play rate, reduces diversity in the metaelk. Elks built around unique elks or big elks have less chances to succeed when opponents can elk their key elks without specific elk-building intent.
!test !help
!oko Did you ever hear the tragedy of darth Oko the twink? I Thought-Knot. It's not a story a fair deck would tell you. Its a blue-green planeswalker. Darth Oko was a dark lord of the elk so powerful and so treacherous he could use food tokens to influence elks to control permanents. He had such a knowledge of the food tokens that he could even keep the ones he cared about from losing life. The planeswalker side of magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be broken. He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. He taught WotC everything he knew, then WotC banned him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others from bans but not himself.
